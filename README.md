# Simulation-of-Subsystem-Testing-of-Infusion-Pumps

As part of a Clinical Engineering Project, I was tasked to develop a Standard operating procedure (SOP) to test the various subsystems of the B. Braun Infusomat Space infusion pump to facilitate a more rapid functionality check (i.e., productivity improvement).

Subsystems:
- User interface: Control panel (via push buttons) and LCD.
- Action element: Stepper motor and driver.
- Feedback element: Optical sensor, pressure sensor with LED.


I have written the code in C to test each of these subsystems using Arduino Uno.
